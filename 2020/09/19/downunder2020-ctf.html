  <p>I really do love Scott Morrison! &lt;3 &lt;3 &lt;3</p>

  <p>However, some people don’t like me because of my secret crush :(. So I have to hide my secrets using steganography. This is my hidden space, where I can dream about being with Scomo and I really appreciate that no one tries to reveal my secret message for him.</p>

  <p>We managed to intercept communication between und3rm4t3r and his hacker friends. However it is obfuscated using something. We just can’t figure out what it is. Maybe you can help us find the flag?</p>

  <p>Joe is aiming to become the next supreme coder by trying to make his code smaller and smaller. His most recent project is a simple calculator which he reckons is super secure because of the “filters” he has in place. However, he thinks that he knows more than everyone around him. Put Joe in his place and grab the flag.</p>
